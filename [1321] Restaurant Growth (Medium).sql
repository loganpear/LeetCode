"""
OVERVIEW: In this SQL query, I calculate the moving average of the total amount spent by customers
in a seven-day window, including the current day and the six preceding days. I first create a CTE 
to sum the total amount for each individual date. It then cross joins this CTE on itself to calculate
the moving average by summing amounts over the specified period. The final result filters out any
records that do not have at least seven days of data, ensuring the moving average is calculated 
only for complete periods.
"""
    
-- This CTE is the total amount of each individual date
with sum_cte as(
    select 
        visited_on,
        sum(amount) as amount
    from Customer
    group by visited_on
)
-- This selects the total amount and moving average of each 7 day period 
select 
    t1.visited_on,
    sum(t2.amount) as amount, 
    round(avg(t2.amount), 2) as average_amount

-- This corss joins the CTE on itself where t2 consists of a specific date and the 6 days prior 
from sum_cte t1 join sum_cte t2
where datediff(t1.visited_on, t2.visited_on) between 0 and 6
group by t1.visited_on

-- This makes sure there are records of at least 6 days pior (so > 6 since it needs to be 7 including the current day)
having count(*) > 6

Table: Customer

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
 

You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). average_amount should be rounded to two decimal places.

Return the result table ordered by visited_on in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Output: 
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08   | 840          | 120            |

| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86
